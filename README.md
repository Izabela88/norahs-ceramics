- ### **Code validation**

  - #### **W3C HTML Code Validator**

    Each page for the website was run through the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) and returned no errors.
    As all web pages are rendered dynamically using the Django template, each page and scenario had to be validated by direct input by copying and pasting the source code for the page.

  - #### **W3C CSS Jigsaw Validator**

    Each CSS file was tested with [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) via direct input and returned no errors

  - #### **JSHint validator**

    All JavaScripts files were tested with [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) and returned no errors.

  - #### **Python 8**

    Each python file was run through [PEP8 online](http://pep8online.com/) and returned no errors.

  - ### **Responsiveness and compatibility**

    The website was tested on Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera and Safari browsers.
    The Safari browser doesn't support the 'smooth' behavior parameter in the window.scroll() method.
    The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop (Macbook Pro 16 inch), Mobiles( Huawei P20 Mate, Huawei P30, Samsung S21 ultra).
    A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
    Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to identify bugs and user experience issues.

## **DEPLOYMENT**

- ### **Deployment on Heroku**

  - This project is deployed on Heroku for production, with all static and media files stored on Cloudinary. These are steps to deploy on Heroku:

  - Navigate to Heroku.com, create a new account or login if you already have an account. On the dashboard page, click "Create New App" button. Give the app a name. Set the region closest to you, and click "Create App".
  - On the resources tab, provision a new Heroku Postgres database.
  - Configure variables on Heroku by navigating to Settings, and click on Reveal Config Vars. You may not have all the values yet. Add the others as you progress through the steps.  
     Varables | Key |
    ---| ---  
     CLOUDINARY_URL | generated in Cloudinary account  
     DATABASE_URL | your database url  
     EMAIL | your email used for SMTP configuration  
     EMAIL_PASSWORD | your email password used for SMTP configuration  
     ENV | PRODUCTION
     MAILCHIMP_API_KEY | generated in Mailchimp account  
     MAILCHIMP_DATA_CENTER | generated in Mailchimp account  
     MAILCHIMP_EMAIL_LIST_ID | generated in Mailchimp account
     SECRET_KEY | your secret key
     STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY | generated in Stripe account
     STRIPE_SECRET_KEY | generated in Stripe account

  - install dj_database_url and psycopg2.

  ```
  pip3 install dj_database_url
  pip3 install psycopg2-binary
  ```

  - Set up a new database for the site by going to the project's settings.py and importing dj_database_url. Comment out the database's default configuration, and replace the default database with a call to dj_database_url. parse and pass it the database URL from Heroku (you can get it from your config variables in your app setting tab)

  ```
  DATABASES = {
    'default': dj_database_url.parse('YOUR_DATABASE_URL_FROM_HEROKU')
  }
  ```

  - Run migrations

  ```
  python3 manage.py migrate
  ```

  - Set up a new superuser, fill out the username, email address, and password.

  ```
  python3 manage.py create superuser
  ```

  - Remove the database config from Heroku and uncomment the original config. Add a conditional statement to define that when the app is running on Heroku. we connect to Postgres, and otherwise, we connect to Sqlite.

  ```
  if os.getenv("ENV") == "PRODUCTION":
    DATABASES = {
        "default": dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
    }
  else:
      DATABASES = {
          "default": {
              "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.sqlite3",
              "NAME": BASE_DIR / "db.sqlite3",
          }
      }
  ```

  - Install gunicorn (if you haven't) which will act as the webserver, and put it on the requirements.txt.

  ```
  pip3 install gunicorn
  pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
  ```

  Note: you don't have to do this if you've installed all dependencies in the requirements.txt file.

  - Create a Procfile, to tell Heroku to create a web dyno, which will run unicorn and serve the Django app.

  Inside the Procfile:

  ```
  release: python manage.py migrate
  web: gunicorn norahs_ceramics.wsgi
  ```

  - Login to Heroku through CLI, using `heroku login`. Once logged in, disable the collect static temporarily, so that Heroku won't try to collect static files when it deploys.

  ```
  heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app norahs_ceramics
  ```

  And add the hostname of the Heroku app to allowed hosts in the project's settings.py, and also add localhost so that Gitpod will still work as well:

  ```
  ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["norahsceramics.herokuapp.com/", "localhost", "127.0.0.1"]
  ```

  - Add, commit, and push to Github and then to Heroku. After pushing to Github as usual, initialize git remote first:

  ```
  heroku git:remote -a norahs_ceramics
  ```

  Then push to Heroku:

  ```
  git push heroku main
  ```

  - Go to the app's dashboard on Heroku and go to Deploy. Connect the app to Github by clicking Github and search for the repository. Click connect. Also enable the automatic deploy by clicking Enable Automatic Deploys, so that everytime we push to github, the code will automatically be deployed to Heroku as well.
  - Go back to settings.py and replace the secret key setting with the call to get it from the environment, and use empty string as a default.

  ```
  SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY', '')
  ```

  Set debug to be true only if there's a variable called development in the environment.

  ```
  if os.getenv("ENV") == "PRODUCTION":
    DEBUG = False
    X_FRAME_OPTIONS = "SAMEORIGIN"
  else:
    DEBUG = True
  ```

- ### **How to run the code locally**

  - ### **Forking the GitHub Repository**

  By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

  1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Izabela88/norahs-ceramics)
  2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page), just above the "Settings" button on the menu, locate the "Fork" button.
  3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

  - ### **Making a Local Clone**

  1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Izabela88/norahs-ceramics)
  2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
  3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
  4. Open Git Bash
  5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
  6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
  ```

  7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
  > Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
  > remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
  > remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
  > remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
  > Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
  ```
